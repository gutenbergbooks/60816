/* We specify an explicit font for the mathematics because not all
   default fonts will include ratio ∶ U+2236 and proportion ∷ U+2237;
   we also use prime ′ U+2032, double prime ″ U+2033, therefore ∴ U+2234,
   and angle ∠ U+2220.
   The downside is that we need to include explicit line-height everywhere
   because math fonts often have enormous default glyph height and depth
   (for example Cambria Math and Stix Two Math). This doesn't work for Kindle
   Previewer (lines are stretched apart), but listing a non-math font first
   seems to fix it.
   Uppercase variables are set as small-caps, lowercase as italic.
   We use explicit non-breaking spaces to match the original. */

<p><span class="smc">For</span> some time back I have felt the want, among Students
of Drawing, of a written code of accurate Perspective Law;
the modes of construction in common use being various, and,
for some problems, insufficient. It would have been desirable
to draw up such a code in popular language, so as to do
away with the most repulsive difficulties of the subject;
but finding this popularization would be impossible, without
elaborate figures and long explanations, such as I had no
leisure to prepare, I have arranged the necessary rules in a
short mathematical form, which any schoolboy may read
through in a few days, after he has mastered the first three
and the sixth books of Euclid.</p>

<p>Some awkward compromises have been admitted between
the first-attempted popular explanation, and the severer
arrangement, involving irregular lettering and redundant
phraseology; but I cannot for the present do more, and leave
the book therefore to its trial, hoping that, if it be found by
masters of schools to answer its purpose, I may hereafter
bring it into better form.<a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1"
 href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>1<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>An account of practical methods, sufficient for general
purposes of sketching, might indeed have been set down in
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>x<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>much less space: but if the student reads the following pages
carefully, he will not only find himself able, on occasion,
to solve perspective problems of a complexity greater than
the ordinary rules will reach, but obtain a clue to many
important laws of pictorial effect, no less than of outline.
The subject thus examined becomes, at least to my mind,
very curious and interesting; but, for students who are
unable or unwilling to take it up in this abstract form, I
believe good help will be soon furnished, in a series of illustrations
of practical perspective now in preparation by Mr. Le Vengeur. I have not seen this essay in an advanced
state, but the illustrations shown to me were very clear and
good; and, as the author has devoted much thought to their
arrangement, I hope that his work will be precisely what
is wanted by the general learner.</p>

<p>Students wishing to pursue the subject into its more
extended branches will find, I believe, Cloquet’s treatise the
best hitherto published.<a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2"

<hr class="short" />


<p class="fakeh2">INTRODUCTION.</p>


<p><span class="smc">When</span> you begin to read this book, sit down very near
the window, and shut the window. I hope the view out of
it is pretty; but, whatever the view may be, we shall find
enough in it for an illustration of the first principles of
perspective (or, literally, of “looking through”).</p>

<p>Every pane of your window may be considered, if you
choose, as a glass picture; and what you see through it, as
painted on its surface.</p>

<p>And if, holding your head still, you extend your hand to
the glass, you may, with a brush full of any thick color, trace,
roughly, the lines of the landscape on the glass.</p>

<p>But, to do this, you must hold your head very still. Not
only you must not move it sideways, nor up and down, but
it must not even move backwards or forwards; for, if you
move your head forwards, you will see <em>more</em> of the landscape
through the pane; and, if you move it backwards, you will
see <em>less</em>: or considering the pane of glass as a picture, when
you hold your head near it, the objects are painted small,
and a great many of them go into a little space; but, when
you hold your head some distance back, the objects are
painted larger upon the pane, and fewer of them go into the
field of it.</p>

<p>But, besides holding your head still, you must, when you
try to trace the picture on the glass, shut one of your eyes.
If you do not, the point of the brush appears double; and,
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on farther experiment, you will observe that each of your
eyes sees the object in a different place on the glass, so that
the tracing which is true to the sight of the right eye is a
couple of inches (or more, according to your distance from
the pane,) to the left of that which is true to the sight of
the left.</p>

<p>Thus, it is only possible to draw what you see through
the window rightly on the surface of the glass, by fixing one
eye at a given point, and neither moving it to the right nor
left, nor up nor down, nor backwards nor forwards. Every
picture drawn in true perspective may be considered as an
upright piece of glass,<a name="fn3" id="fn3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3"
 href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> on which the objects seen through
it have been thus drawn. Perspective can, therefore, only be
quite right, by being calculated for one fixed position of the
eye of the observer; nor will it ever appear <em>deceptively</em> right
unless seen precisely from the point it is calculated for.
Custom, however, enables us to feel the rightness of the work
on using both our eyes, and to be satisfied with it, even
when we stand at some distance from the point it is
designed for.</p>

<p>Supposing that, instead of a window, an unbroken plate
of crystal extended itself to the right and left of you, and
high in front, and that you had a brush as long as you
wanted (a mile long, suppose), and could paint with such
a brush, then the clouds high up, nearly over your head,
and the landscape far away to the right and left, might be
traced, and painted, on this enormous crystal field.<a name="fn4" id="fn4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4"
 href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> But
if the field were so vast (suppose a mile high and a mile
wide), certainly, after the picture was done, you would not
stand as near to it, to see it, as you are now sitting near to
your window. In order to trace the upper clouds through
your great glass, you would have had to stretch your neck
<a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>quite back, and nobody likes to bend their neck back to see
the top of a picture. So you would walk a long way back
to see the great picture—a quarter of a mile, perhaps,—and
then all the perspective would be wrong, and would
look quite distorted, and you would discover that you ought
to have painted it from the greater distance, if you meant
to look at it from that distance. Thus, the distance at which
you intend the observer to stand from a picture, and for
which you calculate the perspective, ought to regulate to
a certain degree the size of the picture. If you place the
point of observation near the canvas, you should not make
the picture very large: <em>vice versâ<!-- TN: circumflex invisible --></em>, if you place the point of
observation far from the canvas, you should not make it
very small; the fixing, therefore, of this point of observation
determines, as a matter of convenience, within certain limits,
the size of your picture. But it does not determine this size
by any perspective law; and it is a mistake made by many
writers on perspective, to connect some of their rules definitely
with the size of the picture. For, suppose that you
had what you now see through your window painted actually
upon its surface, it would be quite optional to cut out any
piece you chose, with the piece of the landscape that was
painted on it. You might have only half a pane, with a single
tree; or a whole pane, with two trees and a cottage; or two
panes, with the whole farmyard and pond; or four panes,
with farmyard, pond, and foreground. And any of these
pieces, if the landscape upon them were, as a scene, pleasantly
composed, would be agreeable pictures, though of quite
different sizes; and yet they would be all calculated for the
same distance of observation.</p>

<p>In the following treatise, therefore, I keep the size of
the picture entirely undetermined. I consider the field of
canvas as wholly unlimited, and on that condition determine
the perspective laws. After we know how to apply those
laws without limitation, we shall see what limitations of the
size of the picture their results may render advisable.</p>

<p>But although the size of the <em>picture</em> is thus independent
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the observer’s distance, the size of the <em>object represented</em> in
the picture is not. On the contrary, that size is fixed by
absolute mathematical law; that is to say, supposing you have
to draw a tower a hundred feet high, and a quarter of a mile
distant from you, the height which you ought to give that
tower on your paper depends, with mathematical precision,
on the distance at which you intend your paper to be placed.
So, also, do all the rules for drawing the form of the tower,
whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Hence, the first thing to be done in beginning a drawing
is to fix, at your choice, this distance of observation, or the
distance at which you mean to stand from your paper. After
that is determined, all is determined, except only the ultimate
size of your picture, which you may make greater, or
less, not by altering the size of the things represented, but
by <em>taking in more, or fewer</em> of them. So, then, before proceeding
to apply any practical perspective rule, we must
always have our distance of observation marked, and the
most convenient way of marking it is the following:</p>

AND STATION-LINE.<br

<h3 class="ss" title="I. The Sight-Point">I. The Sight-Point.—</h3><p>Let <span class="maths">A B C D</span>, <a href="#f.1">Fig. 1.</a>, be your sheet
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of paper, the larger the better, though perhaps we may cut
out of it at last only a small piece for our picture, such as the
dotted circle <span class="maths">N O P Q</span>. This circle is not intended to limit
either the size or shape of our picture: you may ultimately
have it round or oval, horizontal or upright, small or large,
as you choose. I only dot the line to give you an idea of
whereabouts you will probably like to have it; and, as the
operations of perspective are more conveniently performed
upon paper underneath the picture than above it, I put this
conjectural circle at the top of the paper, about the middle of
it, leaving plenty of paper on both sides and at the bottom.
Now, as an observer generally stands near the middle of a
picture to look at it, we had better at first, and for simplicity’s
sake, fix the point of observation opposite the middle of
our conjectural picture. So take the point <span class="maths">S</span>, the center
of the circle <span class="maths">N O P Q</span>;—or, which will be simpler for you in
your own work, take the point <span class="maths">S</span> at random near the top of
your paper, and strike the circle <span class="maths">N O P Q</span> round it, any size
you like. Then the point <span class="maths">S</span><!-- TN: original has normal roman S --> is to represent the point <em>opposite</em>
which you wish the observer of your picture to place his eye,
in looking at it. Call this point the “Sight-Point.”</p><p class="endrunin"> </p>


<h3 class="ss" title="II. The Sight-Line">II. The Sight-Line.—</h3><p>Through the Sight-point, <span class="maths">S</span>, draw
a horizontal line, <span class="maths">G H</span>, right across your paper from side to
side, and call this line the “Sight-Line.”</p><p class="endrunin"> </p>

<p>This line is of great practical use, representing the level
of the eye of the observer all through the picture. You will
find hereafter that if there is a horizon to be represented in
your picture, as of distant sea or plain, this line defines it.</p>


<h3 class="ss" title="III. The Station-Line">III. The Station-Line.—</h3><p>From <span class="maths">S</span> let fall a perpendicular
line, <span class="maths">S R</span>, to the bottom of the paper, and call this line the
“Station-Line.”</p><p class="endrunin"> </p>

<p>This represents the line on which the observer stands, at a

Hold your paper upright in front of you, and hold your pencil

upon this line, and operations which we have to perform with
it, are just the same when it is drawn on the paper itself,
below <span class="maths">S</span>, as they would be if it were represented by a wire in
the position of the leveled pencil, and as they are much more
easily performed when it is drawn on the paper, it is always
in practice, so drawn.</p>


<h3 class="ss" title="IV. The Station-Point">IV. The Station-Point.—</h3><p>On this line, mark the distance
<span class="maths">S T</span> at your pleasure, for the distance at which you wish
your picture to be seen, and call the point <span class="maths">T</span><!-- TN: original has normal T --> the “Station-Point.”</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.2" src="images/illus-016.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 2.</b></p>

<p>In practice, it is generally advisable to make the distance
<span class="maths">S T</span> about as great as the diameter of your intended picture;
and it should, for the most part, be more rather than less;
but, as I have just stated, this is quite arbitrary. However,
in this figure, as an approximation to a generally advisable
distance, I make the distance <span class="maths">S T</span> equal to the diameter of the
circle <span class="maths">N O P Q</span>. Now, having fixed this distance, <span class="maths">S T</span>, all the
dimensions of the objects in our picture are fixed likewise,
and for this <span class="nw">reason:—</span></p>

<p>Let the upright line <span class="maths">A B</span>, <a href="#f.2">Fig. 2.</a>, represent a pane of glass
placed where our picture is to be placed; but seen at the side
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of it, edgeways; let <span class="maths">S</span> be the Sight-point; <span class="maths">S T</span> the Station-line,
which, in this figure, observe, is in its true position, drawn
out from the paper, not down upon it; and <span class="maths">T</span> the Station-point.</p>

<p>Suppose the Station-line <span class="maths">S T</span> to be continued, or in mathematical
language “produced,” through <span class="maths">S</span>, far beyond the pane
of glass, and let <span class="maths">P Q</span> be a tower or other upright object situated
on or above this line.</p>

<p>Now the <em>apparent</em> height of the tower <span class="maths">P Q</span> is measured by
the angle <span class="maths">Q T P</span>, between the rays of light which come from
the top and bottom of it to the eye of the observer. But the
<em>actual</em> height of the <em>image</em> of the tower on the pane of glass
<span class="maths">A B</span>, between us and it, is the distance <span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> between the
points where the rays traverse the glass.</p>

<p>Evidently, the farther from the point <span class="maths">T</span> we place the glass,
making <span class="maths">S T</span> longer, the larger will be the image; and the
nearer we place it to <span class="maths">T</span>, the smaller the image, and that in
a fixed ratio. Let the distance <span class="maths">D T</span> be the direct distance from
the Station-point to the foot of the object. Then, if we place
the glass <span class="maths">A B</span> at one-third of that whole distance, <span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> will be
one-third of the real height of the object; if we place the
glass at two-thirds of the distance, as at <span class="maths">E F</span>, <span class="maths">P″ Q″</span> (the
height of the image at that point) will be two-thirds the
height<a name="fn5" id="fn5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5"
 href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> of the object, and so on. Therefore the mathematical
law is that <span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> will be to <span class="maths">P Q</span> as <span class="maths">S T</span> to <span class="maths">D T</span>. I put
this ratio clearly by itself that you may remember it:</p>

<div class="displaymath">
<a name="eq1" id="eq1"></a><span class="maths">P′ Q′ ∶ P Q ∷ S T ∶ D T</span><a title="See image"
 href="#eqn1" class="eqnlink">[<span class="ns">eqn </span>i]</a>
<p>or in words:</p>
<span class="maths">P</span> dash <span class="maths">Q</span> dash is to <span class="maths">P Q</span> as <span class="maths">S T</span> to <span class="maths">D T</span>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In which formula, recollect that <span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> is the height of the
appearance of the object on the picture; <span class="maths">P Q</span> the height of the
object itself; <span class="maths">S</span> the Sight-point;<!-- TN: original has colon --> <span class="maths">T</span> the Station-point; <span class="maths">D</span> a point
at the direct distance of the object; though the object is
<a name="png.018" id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>seldom placed actually on the line <span class="maths">T S</span> produced, and may be
far to the right or left of it, the formula is still the same.</p>

<p>For let <span class="maths">S</span>, <a href="#f.3">Fig. 3.</a>, be the Sight-point, and <span class="maths">A B</span> the glass—here
seen looking <em>down</em> on its <em>upper edge</em>, not sideways;—then
if the tower (represented now, as on a map, by the dark
square), instead of being at <span class="maths">D</span> on the line <span class="maths">S T</span> produced, be at
<span class="maths">E</span>, to the right (or left) of the spectator,
still the apparent height of
the tower on <span class="maths">A B</span> will be as <span class="maths">S′ T</span> to
<span class="maths">E T</span>, which is the same ratio as that
of <span class="maths">S T</span> to <span class="maths">D T</span>.</p>

<p class="illolt"><img id="f.3" src="images/illus-018.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 3.</b></p>

<p>Now in many perspective problems,
the position of an object is
more conveniently expressed by the
two measurements <span class="maths">D T</span> and <span class="maths">D E</span>, than
by the single oblique measurement
<span class="maths">E T</span>.</p>

<p>I shall call <span class="maths">D T</span> the “direct distance”
of the object at <span class="maths">E</span>, and <span class="maths">D E</span>
its “lateral distance.” It is rather
a license to call <span class="maths">D T</span> its “direct”
distance, for <span class="maths">E T</span> is the more direct
of the two; but there is no other term which would not cause
confusion.</p>

<p>Lastly, in order to complete our knowledge of the position
of an object, the vertical height of some point in it, above or
below the eye, must be given; that is to say, either <span class="maths">D P</span> or <span class="maths">D Q</span>
in <a href="#f.2">Fig. 2.</a><a name="fn6" id="fn6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6"
 href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>: this I shall call the “vertical distance” of the
point given. In all perspective problems these three distances,
and the dimensions of the object, must be stated,
otherwise the problem is imperfectly given. It ought not to
be required of us merely to draw <em>a</em> room or <em>a</em> church in perspective;
but to draw <em>this</em> room from <em>this</em> corner, and <em>that</em>
church on <em>that</em> spot, in perspective. For want of knowing
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>how to base their drawings on the measurement and place
of the object, I have known practiced students represent a
parish church, certainly in true perspective, but with a nave
about two miles and a half long.</p>

<p>It is true that in drawing landscapes from nature the sizes
and distances of the objects cannot be accurately known.
When, however, we know how to draw them rightly, if their
size were given, we have only to <em>assume a rational approximation</em>
to their size, and the resulting drawing will be true
enough for all intents and purposes. It does not in the least
matter that we represent a distant cottage as eighteen feet
long, when it is in reality only seventeen; but it matters much
that we do not represent it as eighty feet long, as we easily
might if we had not been accustomed to draw from measurement.
Therefore, in all the following problems the measurement
of the object is given.</p>

<p>The student must observe, however, that in order to bring
the diagrams into convenient compass, the measurements
assumed are generally very different from any likely to occur
in practice. Thus, in <a href="#f.3">Fig. 3.</a>, the distance <span class="maths">D S</span> would be probably
in practice half a mile or a mile, and the distance <span class="maths">T S</span>,
from the eye of the observer to the paper, only two or three
feet. The mathematical law is however precisely the same,
whatever the proportions; and I use such proportions as are
best calculated to make the diagram clear.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, the conditions of a perspective problem
are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Sight-line <span class="maths">G H</span> given, <a href="#f.1">Fig. 1.</a>;</li>
<li>The Sight-point <span class="maths">S</span> given;</li>
<li>The Station-point <span class="maths">T</span> given; and</li>
<li>The three distances of the object,<a name="fn7" id="fn7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7"
 href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> direct, lateral, and
  vertical, with its dimensions, given.</li>
</ul>

<p>The size of the picture, conjecturally limited by the dotted
circle, is to be determined afterwards at our pleasure. On
these conditions I proceed at once to construction.</p>

<p>So that, in order to determine the length of <var>a b</var>, we need

draw through <var>a</var> a horizontal line <span class="maths"><var>a</var> R′</span>, make <span class="maths"><var>a</var> R′</span> equal to the

and retaining only <span class="maths">R′ M</span> and <span class="maths"><var>a</var> V</span>, as in <a href="#f.14">Fig. 14.</a>, produce the

<span class="maths">V N</span> must, by similar triangles, be equal to <span class="maths">V M</span> (equal to <span class="maths">V T</span>
in <a href="#f.13">Fig. 13.</a>).</p>

<p>Therefore, on whichever side of <span class="maths">V</span> we measure the distance
<span class="maths">V T</span>, so as to obtain either the point <span class="maths">M</span>, or the point <span class="maths">N</span>, if we

<p>The points <span class="maths">M</span> and <span class="maths">N</span> are called the “<span class="smc">Dividing-Points</span>” of

also, and still cut the sight-line in <span class="maths">V</span>.</small></p>

<p class="ctd"><small>The construction will be seen to be founded on the second <a href="#cor.ii.ii">Corollary</a> of

<p class="ctd"><small>It is evident that if any other line, as <span class="maths">M N</span> in <a href="#f.9">Fig. 9.</a>, parallel to <span class="maths">A B</span>,

<p>Supposing it were now required to draw a line <span class="maths">A C</span> (<a href="#f.17">Fig. 17.</a>) twice as long as <span class="maths">A B</span>, it is evident that the sight-magnitude
<var>a c′</var> must be twice as long as the sight-magnitude <var>a b′</var>;
we have, therefore, merely to continue the horizontal line
<var>a b′</var>, make <var>b′ c′</var> equal to <var>a b′</var>, join <span class="maths"><var>c</var> M′</span>, cutting <span class="maths"><var>a</var> V</span> in <var>c</var>, and
<var>a c</var> will be the line required. Similarly, if we have to draw
a line <span class="maths">A D</span>, three times the length of <span class="maths">A B</span>, <var>a d′</var> must be three
times the length of <var>a b′</var>, and, joining <span class="maths"><var>d′</var> M</span>, <var>a d</var> will be the line
required.</p>

<p>The student will observe that the nearer the portions cut
off, <var>b c</var>, <var>c d</var>, etc., approach the point <span class="maths">V</span>, the smaller they
become; and, whatever lengths may be added to the line <span class="maths">A D</span>,
and successively cut off from <span class="maths"><var>a</var> V</span>, the line <span class="maths"><var>a</var> V</span> will never be
cut off entirely, but the portions cut off will become infinitely
small, and apparently “vanish” as they approach the point
<span class="maths">V</span>; hence this point is called the “vanishing” point.</p>

<p>It is evident that if the line <span class="maths">A D</span> had been given originally,
and we had been required to draw it, and divide it into three
equal parts, we should have had only to divide its sight-magnitude,
<var>a d′</var>, into the three equal parts, <var>a b′</var>, <var>b′ c′</var>, and
<var>c′ d′</var>, and then, drawing to <span class="maths">M</span> from <var>b′</var> and <var>c′</var>, the line <var>a d</var> would
have been divided as required in <var>b</var> and <var>c</var>. And supposing the
original line <span class="maths">A D</span> be divided <em>irregularly into any number</em> of
parts, if the line <var>a d′</var> be divided into a similar number in the
same proportions (by the construction given in Appendix I.),
and, from these points of division, lines are drawn to <span class="maths">M</span>,
they will divide the line <var>a d</var> in true perspective into a similar
number of proportionate parts.</p>

<p>The horizontal line drawn through <var>a</var>, on which the sight-magnitudes
are measured, is called the “<span class="smc">Measuring-line</span>.”</p>

<p>And the line <var>a d</var>, when properly divided in <var>b</var> and <var>c</var>, or any
other required points, is said to be divided “<span class="allsc">IN PERSPECTIVE
RATIO</span>” to the divisions of the original line <span class="maths">A D</span>.</p>

<p>As the ground plan of most buildings is rectangular, it

practice whether the vanishing-points are thrown a little
more or a little less to the right or left of <span class="maths">S</span>: but it matters
much that the relation of the vanishing-points should be
accurate. Their position with respect to <span class="maths">S</span> merely causes the
spectator to see a little more or less on one side or other of
the house, which may be a matter of chance or choice; but
their rectangular relation determines the rectangular shape

<p>Any number of points in the curve may be thus determined,
and the curve drawn through the series; in most
cases, three or four will be enough. Practically, complicated
curves may be better drawn in perspective by an experienced
eye than by rule, as the fixing of the various points
in haste involves too many chances of error; but it is well to
draw a good many by rule first, in order to give the eye its
experience.<a name="fn22" id="fn22"></a><a title="Go to footnote 22"

<p>[<i>Obs.</i> In drawing <a href="#f.31">Fig. 31.</a> the station-point has been taken much

<p>If the student turns the book so that <span class="maths">E G</span> may be vertical, <a href="#f.31">Fig. 31.</a>
will represent the construction for drawing a circle in a vertical plane,
the sight-line being then of course parallel to <span class="maths">G L</span>; and the semicircles
<span class="maths">A D B</span>, <span class="maths">A C B</span>, on each side of the diameter <span class="maths">A B</span>, will represent ordinary
semicircular arches seen in perspective. In that case, if the book be
held so that the line <span class="maths">E H</span> is the top of the square, the upper semicircle
will represent a semicircular arch, <em>above</em> the eye, drawn in perspective.
But if the book be held so that the line <span class="maths">G F</span> is the top of the square, the
upper semicircle will represent a semicircular arch, <em>below</em> the eye,
drawn in perspective.</p>

<p>If the book be turned upside down, the figure will represent a circle

under that condition.</p>

<p>If the sides of the rectangle <span class="maths">A C</span> and <span class="maths">A D</span> are given, the
slope of the line <span class="maths">A B</span> is determined; and then its position will
depend on that of the rectangle. If, as in <a href="#f.39">Fig. 39.</a>, the rectangle
is parallel to the picture plane, the line <span class="maths">A B</span> must be
so also. If, as in <a href="#f.40">Fig. 40.</a>, the rectangle is inclined to the

<p>As the horizontal sight-line is drawn through the sight-point,
and the sight-point is opposite the eye, the sight-line
is always on a level with the eye. Above and below the sight-line,
the eye comprehends, as it is raised or depressed while
the head is held upright, about an equal space; and, on each
side of the sight-point, about the same space is easily seen
without turning the head; so that if a picture represented
the true field of easy vision, it ought to be circular, and have
the sight-point in its center. But because some parts of any
given view are usually more interesting than others, either
the uninteresting parts are left out, or somewhat more than
would generally be seen of the interesting parts is included,
by moving the field of the picture a little upwards or downwards,
so as to throw the sight-point low or high. The operation
will be understood in a moment by cutting an aperture
in a piece of pasteboard, and moving it up and down in front
of the eye, without moving the eye. It will be seen to embrace
sometimes the low, sometimes the high objects, without
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>altering their perspective, only the eye will be opposite the
lower part of the aperture when it sees the higher objects,
and <em>vice versâ</em>.</p>

<p>There is no reason, in the laws of perspective, why the
picture should not be moved to the right or left of the sight-point,
as well as up or down. But there is this practical
reason. The moment the spectator sees the horizon in a picture
high, he tries to hold his head high, that is, in its right
place. When he sees the horizon in a picture low, he similarly
tries to put his head low. But, if the sight-point is
thrown to the left hand or right hand, he does not understand
that he is to step a little to the right or left; and if he places
himself, as usual, in the middle, all the perspective is distorted.
Hence it is generally unadvisable to remove the
sight-point laterally, from the center of the picture. The
Dutch painters, however, fearlessly take the license of
placing it to the right or left; and often with good effect.</p>

<p>The rectilinear limitation of the sides, top, and base of
the picture is of course quite arbitrary, as the space of a landscape
would be which was seen through a window; less or
more being seen at the spectator’s pleasure, as he retires or
advances.</p>

<p>The distance of the station-point is not so arbitrary. In
ordinary cases it should not be less than the intended greatest
dimension (height or breadth) of the picture. In most
works by the great masters it is more; they not only calculate
on their pictures being seen at considerable distances,
but they like breadth of mass in buildings, and dislike the
sharp angles which always result from station-points at short
distances.<a name="fn31" id="fn31"></a><a title="Go to footnote 31"
 href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p>Whenever perspective, done by true rule, looks wrong, it
is always because the station-point is too near. Determine,
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the outset, at what distance the spectator is likely to examine
the work, and never use a station-point within a less
distance.</p>

<p>There is yet another and a very important reason, not only
for care in placing the station-point, but for that accurate
calculation of distance and observance of measurement which
have been insisted on throughout this work. All drawings
of objects on a reduced scale are, if rightly executed, drawings
of the appearance of the object at the distance which in
true perspective reduces it to that scale. They are not <em>small</em>
drawings of the object seen near, but drawings the <em>real size</em>
of the object seen far off. Thus if you draw a mountain in
a landscape, three inches high, you do not reduce all the features
of the near mountain so as to come into three inches of
paper. You could not do that. All that you can do is to
give the appearance of the mountain, when it is so far off
that three inches of paper would really hide it from you.
It is precisely the same in drawing any other object. A face
can no more be reduced in scale than a mountain can. It is
infinitely delicate already; it can only be quite rightly rendered
on its own scale, or at least on the slightly diminished
scale which would be fixed by placing the plate of glass, supposed
to represent the field of the picture, close to the
figures. Correggio and Raphael were both fond of this
slightly subdued magnitude of figure. Colossal painting, in
which Correggio excelled all others, is usually the enlargement
of a small picture (as a colossal sculpture is of a small
statue), in order to permit the subject of it to be discerned at
a distance. The treatment of colossal (as distinguished from
ordinary) paintings will depend therefore, in general, on
the principles of optics more than on those of perspective,
though, occasionally, portions may be represented as if they
were the projection of near objects on a plane behind them.
In all points the subject is one of great difficulty and subtlety;
and its examination does not fall within the compass
of this essay.</p>

<p>Lastly, it will follow from these considerations, and the
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>conclusion is one of great practical importance, that, though
pictures may be enlarged, they cannot be reduced, in copying
them. All attempts to engrave pictures completely on a reduced
scale are, for this reason, nugatory. The best that can
be done is to give the aspect of the picture at the distance
which reduces it in perspective to the size required; or, in
other words, to make a drawing of the distant effect of the
picture. Good painting, like nature’s own work, is infinite,
and unreduceable.</p>

<p>I wish this book had less tendency towards the infinite and
unreduceable. It has so far exceeded the limits I hoped to
give it, that I doubt not the reader will pardon an abruptness
of conclusion, and be thankful, as I am myself, to get to an
end on any terms.</p>

<p class="illort"><img id="f.51" src="images/illus-079.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 51.</b></p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A B</span>, <a href="#f.51">Fig. 51.</a>, be our sheet of
paper, some 3 feet wide. Make <span class="maths">S T</span>
equal to 1½ foot. Draw the line of
sight through <span class="maths">S</span>. Produce <span class="maths">T S</span>, and
make <span class="maths">D S</span> equal to 2 feet, therefore <span class="maths">T D</span>
equal to 3½ feet. Draw <span class="maths">D C</span>, equal to
2 feet; <span class="maths">C P</span>, equal to 4 feet. Join
<span class="maths">T C</span> (cutting the sight-line in <span class="maths">Q</span>)
and <span class="maths">T P</span>.</p>

<p>Let fall the vertical <span class="maths">Q P′</span>, then <span class="maths">P′</span>
is the point required.</p>

<p>If the lines, as in the figure, fall
outside of your sheet of paper, in
order to draw them, it is necessary to attach other sheets of
paper to its edges. This is inconvenient, but must be done
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at first that you may see your way clearly; and sometimes
afterwards, though there are expedients for doing without
such extension in fast sketching.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that no extension of surface could
be of any use to us, if the distance <span class="maths">T D</span>, instead of being 3½
feet, were 100 feet, or a mile, as it might easily be in a
landscape.</p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, to obtain some other means of
construction; to do which we must examine the principle of
the problem.</p>


<p class="tb">In the analysis of <a href="#f.2">Fig. 2.</a>, in the introductory remarks, I
used the word “height” only of the tower, <span class="maths">Q P</span>, because it
was only to its vertical height that the law deduced from the
figure could be applied. For suppose it had been a pyramid,
as <span class="maths">O Q P</span>, <a href="#f.52">Fig. 52.</a>, then the image of its side, <span class="maths">Q P</span>, being,
like every other magnitude, limited on the glass <span class="maths">A B</span> by the
lines coming from its extremities, would appear only of the
length <span class="maths">Q′ S</span>; and it is not true that <span class="maths">Q′ S</span> is to <span class="maths">Q P</span> as <span class="maths">T S</span> is to
<span class="maths">T P</span>. But if we let fall a vertical <span class="maths">Q D</span> from <span class="maths">Q</span>, so as to get
the vertical height of the pyramid, then it is true that <span class="maths">Q′ S</span> is
to <span class="maths">Q D</span> as <span class="maths">T S</span> is to <span class="maths">T D</span>.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.52" src="images/illus-080.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 52.</b></p>

<p>Supposing this figure represented, not a pyramid, but a
triangle on the ground, and that <span class="maths">Q D</span> and <span class="maths">Q P</span> are horizontal
lines, expressing lateral distance from the line <span class="maths">T D</span>, still the
rule would be false for <span class="maths">Q P</span> and true for <span class="maths">Q D</span>. And, similarly,
it is true for all lines which are parallel, like <span class="maths">Q D</span>, to
<a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the plane of the picture <span class="maths">A B</span>, and false for all lines which are
inclined to it at an angle.</p>

<p>Hence generally. Let <span class="maths">P Q</span> (<a href="#f.2">Fig. 2.</a> in Introduction, <a href="#png.016">p. 6</a>)
be any magnitude <em>parallel to the plane of the picture</em>; and
<span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> its image on the picture.</p>

<p>Then always the formula is true which you learned in
the Introduction: <span class="maths">P′ Q′</span> is to <span class="maths">P Q</span> as <span class="maths">S T</span> is to <span class="maths">D T</span>.</p>

<p>Now the magnitude <span class="maths">P</span> dash <span class="maths">Q</span> dash in this formula I call
the “<span class="allsc">SIGHT-MAGNITUDE</span>” of the line <span class="maths">P Q</span>. The student must
fix this term, and the meaning of it, well in his mind. The
“sight-magnitude” of a line is the magnitude which bears
to the real line the same proportion that the distance of the
picture bears to the distance of the object. Thus, if a tower
be a hundred feet high, and a hundred yards off; and the
picture, or piece of glass, is one yard from the spectator, between
him and the tower; the distance of picture being then
to distance of tower as 1 to 100, the sight-magnitude of the
tower’s height will be as 1 to 100; that is to say, one foot.
If the tower is two hundred yards distant, the sight-magnitude
of its height will be half a foot, and so on.</p>

<p>But farther. It is constantly necessary, in perspective
operations, to measure the other dimensions of objects by
the sight-magnitude of their vertical lines. Thus, if the
tower, which is a hundred feet high, is square, and twenty-five
feet broad on each side; if the sight-magnitude of the
height is one foot, the measurement of the side, reduced to
the same scale, will be the hundredth part of twenty-five feet,
or three inches: and, accordingly, I use in this treatise the
term “sight-magnitude” indiscriminately for all lines reduced
in the same proportion as the vertical lines of the object.
If I tell you to find the “sight-magnitude” of any
line, I mean, always, find the magnitude which bears to that
line the proportion of <span class="maths">S T</span> to <span class="maths">D T</span>; or, in simpler terms, reduce
the line to the scale which you have fixed by the first
determination of the length <span class="maths">S T</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore, you must learn to draw quickly to scale before
you do anything else; for all the measurements of your object
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>must be reduced to the scale fixed by <span class="maths">S T</span> before you can
use them in your diagram. If the object is fifty feet from
you, and your paper one foot, all the lines of the object must
be reduced to a scale of one fiftieth before you can use them;
if the object is two thousand feet from you, and your paper
one foot, all your lines must be reduced to the scale of one
two-thousandth before you can use them, and so on. Only
in ultimate practice, the reduction never need be tiresome,
for, in the case of large distances, accuracy is never required.
If a building is three or four miles distant, a hairbreadth of
accidental variation in a touch makes a difference of ten or
twenty feet in height or breadth, if estimated by accurate
perspective law. Hence it is never attempted to apply
measurements with precision at such distances. Measurements
are only required within distances of, at the most, two
or three hundred feet. Thus it may be necessary to represent
a cathedral nave precisely as seen from a spot seventy
feet in front of a given pillar; but we shall hardly be required
to draw a cathedral three miles distant precisely as seen from
seventy feet in advance of a given milestone. Of course, if
such a thing be required, it can be done; only the reductions
are somewhat long and complicated: in ordinary cases it is
easy to assume the distance <span class="maths">S T</span> so as to get at the reduced
dimensions in a moment. Thus, let the pillar of the nave,
in the case supposed, be 42 feet high, and we are required
to stand 70 feet from it: assume <span class="maths">S T</span> to be equal to 5 feet.
Then, as 5 is to 70 so will the sight-magnitude required be
to 42; that is to say, the sight-magnitude of the pillar’s
height will be 3 feet. If we make <span class="maths">S T</span> equal to 2½ feet, the
pillar’s height will be 1½ foot, and so on.</p>

<p>And for fine divisions into irregular parts which cannot
be measured, the ninth and tenth problems of the sixth book
of Euclid will serve you: the following construction is,
however, I think, more practically <span class="nw">convenient:—</span></p>

<p>The line <span class="maths">A B</span> (<a href="#f.53">Fig. 53.</a>) is divided by given points, <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>,
into a given number of irregularly unequal parts; it is required
to divide any other line, <span class="maths">C D</span>, into an equal number
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>73<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of parts, bearing to each other the same proportions as the
parts of <span class="maths">A B</span>, and arranged in the same order.</p>

<p>Draw the two lines parallel to each other, as in the figure.</p>

<p>Join <span class="maths">A C</span> and <span class="maths">B D</span>, and produce the lines <span class="maths">A C</span>, <span class="maths">B D</span>, till they
meet in <span class="maths">P</span>.</p>

<p>Join <span class="maths"><var>a</var> P</span>, <span class="maths"><var>b</var> P</span>, <span class="maths"><var>c</var> P</span>, cutting <span class="maths"><var>c</var> D</span> in <var>f</var>, <var>g</var>, <var>h</var>.</p>

<p>Then the line <span class="maths">C D</span> is divided as required, in <var>f</var>, <var>g</var>, <var>h</var>.</p>

<p>In the figure the lines <span class="maths">A B</span> and <span class="maths">C D</span> are accidentally perpendicular
to <span class="maths">A P</span>. There is no need for their being so.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.53" src="images/illus-083.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 53.</b></p>

<p>Now, to return to our first problem.</p>

<p>The construction given in the figure is only the quickest
mathematical way of obtaining, on the picture, the sight-magnitudes
of <span class="maths">D C</span> and <span class="maths">P C</span>, which are both magnitudes parallel
with the picture plane. But if these magnitudes are
too great to be thus put on the paper, you have only to obtain
the reduction by scale. Thus, if <span class="maths">T S</span> be one foot, <span class="maths">T D</span>
eighty feet, <span class="maths">D C</span> forty feet, and <span class="maths">C P</span> ninety feet, the distance
<span class="maths">Q S</span> must be made equal to one eightieth of <span class="maths">D C</span>, or half a
foot; and the distance <span class="maths">Q P′</span>, one eightieth of <span class="maths">C P</span>, or one eightieth
of ninety feet; that is to say, nine eighths of a foot, or
thirteen and a half inches. The lines <span class="maths">C T</span> and <span class="maths">P T</span> are thus
<em>practically</em> useless, it being only necessary to measure <span class="maths">Q S</span>
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and <span class="maths">Q P</span>, on your paper, of the due sight-magnitudes. But
the mathematical construction, given in <a href="#pr.i">Problem I.</a>, is the
basis of all succeeding problems, and, if it is once thoroughly
understood and practiced (it can only be thoroughly understood
by practice), all the other problems will follow easily.</p>

<p>Lastly. Observe that any perspective operation whatever
may be performed with reduced dimensions of every line employed,
so as to bring it conveniently within the limits of
your paper. When the required figure is thus constructed
on a small scale, you have only to enlarge it accurately
in the same proportion in which you reduced the lines of
construction, and you will have the figure constructed in
perspective on the scale required for use.</p>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> drawing of most buildings occurring in ordinary
practice will resolve itself into applications of this problem.
In general, any house, or block of houses, presents itself
under the main conditions assumed here in <a href="#f.54">Fig. 54.</a> There
will be an angle or corner somewhere near the spectator, as
<span class="maths">A B</span>; and the level of the eye will usually be above the base
of the building, of which, therefore, the horizontal upper
lines will slope down to the vanishing-points, and the base
lines rise to them. The following practical directions will,
however, meet nearly all <span class="nw">cases:—</span></p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.54" src="images/illus-085.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 54.</b></p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A B</span>, <a href="#f.54">Fig. 54.</a>, be any important vertical line in the
block of buildings; if it is the side of a street, you may fix
upon such a line at the division between two houses. If its
real height, distance, etc., are given, you will proceed with
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the accurate construction of the problem; but usually you
will neither know, nor care, exactly how high the building
is, or how far off. In such case draw the line <span class="maths">A B</span>, as nearly
as you can guess, about the part of the picture it ought to
occupy, and on such a scale as you choose. Divide it into
any convenient number of equal parts, according to the
height you presume it to be. If you suppose it to be twenty
feet high, you may divide it into twenty parts, and let each
part stand for a foot; if thirty feet high, you may divide it
into ten parts, and let each part stand for three feet; if
seventy feet high, into fourteen parts, and let each part stand
for five feet; and so on, avoiding thus very minute divisions
till you come to details. Then observe how high your eye
reaches upon this vertical line; suppose, for instance, that it
is thirty feet high and divided into ten parts, and you are
standing so as to raise your head to about six feet above its
base, then the sight-line may be drawn, as in the figure,
through the second division from the ground. If you are
standing above the house, draw the sight-line above <span class="maths">B</span>; if below
the house, below <span class="maths">A</span>; at such height or depth as you suppose
may be accurate (a yard or two more or less matters
little at ordinary distances, while at great distances perspective
rules become nearly useless, the eye serving you better
than the necessarily imperfect calculation). Then fix your
sight-point and station-point, the latter with proper reference
to the scale of the line <span class="maths">A B</span>. As you cannot, in all probability,
ascertain the exact direction of the line <span class="maths">A V</span> or <span class="maths">B V</span>,
draw the slope <span class="maths">B V</span> as it appears to you, cutting the sight-line
in <span class="maths">V</span>. Thus having fixed one vanishing-point, the other,
and the dividing-points, must be accurately found by rule;
for, as before stated, whether your entire group of points
(vanishing and dividing) falls a little more or less to the
right or left of <span class="maths">S</span> does not signify, but the relation of the
points to each other <em>does</em> signify. Then draw the measuring-line
<span class="maths">B G</span>, either through <span class="maths">A</span> or <span class="maths">B</span>, choosing always the steeper
slope of the two; divide the measuring-line into parts of the
same length as those used on <span class="maths">A B</span>, and let them stand for the
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>same magnitudes. Thus, suppose there are two rows of windows
in the house front, each window six feet high by three
wide, and separated by intervals of three feet, both between
window and window and between tier and tier; each of the
divisions here standing for three feet, the lines drawn from
<span class="maths">B G</span> to the dividing-point <span class="maths">D</span> fix the lateral dimensions, and the
divisions on <span class="maths">A B</span> the vertical ones. For other magnitudes it
would be necessary to subdivide the parts on the measuring-line,
or on <span class="maths">A B</span>, as required. The lines which regulate the
inner sides or returns of the windows (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, etc.) of course
are drawn to the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">B F</span> (the other side of the
house), if <span class="maths">F B V</span> represents a right angle; if not, their own
vanishing-point must be found separately for these returns.
But see <a href="#png.095">Practice on Problem XI</a>.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.55" src="images/illus-087.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 55.</b></p>

<p>Interior angles, such as <span class="maths">E B C</span>, <a href="#f.55">Fig. 55.</a> (suppose the corner
of a room), are to be treated in the same way, each side of
the room having its measurements separately carried to it

cases that we have to carry the measurement <em>up</em> from the
corner <span class="maths">B</span>, and that the sight-magnitudes are given us from
the length of the line <span class="maths">A B</span>. For instance, suppose the room

<p><span class="smc">This</span> is one of the most important foundational problems
in perspective, and it is necessary that the student should
entirely familiarize himself with its conditions.</p>

<p>In order to do so, he must first observe these general
relations of magnitude in any pyramid on a square base.</p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A G H′</span>, <a href="#f.56">Fig. 56.</a>, be any pyramid on a square base.</p>

<p class="illolt"><img id="f.56" src="images/illus-089a.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 56.</b></p>

<p>The best terms in which its magnitude
can be given, are the length of one side of
its base, <span class="maths">A H</span>, and its vertical altitude (<span class="maths">C D</span>
in <a href="#f.25">Fig. 25.</a>); for, knowing these, we know
all the other magnitudes. But these are
not the terms in which its size will be
usually ascertainable. Generally, we shall
have given us, and be able to ascertain by
measurement, one side of its base <span class="maths">A H</span>, and either <span class="maths">A G</span> the
length of one of the lines of its angles, or <span class="maths">B G</span> (or <span class="maths">B′ G</span>) the
length of a line drawn from its vertex, <span class="maths">G</span>, to the middle of
the side of its base. In measuring a real pyramid, <span class="maths">A G</span> will
usually be the line most easily found; but in many architectural
problems <span class="maths">B G</span> is given, or is most easily ascertainable.</p>

<p>Observe therefore this general construction.</p>

<p class="illort"><img id="f.57" src="images/illus-089b.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 57.</b></p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A B D E</span>, <a href="#f.57">Fig. 57.</a>, be the square base
of any pyramid.</p>

<p>Draw its diagonals, <span class="maths">A E</span>, <span class="maths">B D</span>, cutting
each other in its center, <span class="maths">C</span>.</p>

<p>Bisect any side, <span class="maths">A B</span>, in <span class="maths">F</span>.</p>

<p>From <span class="maths">F</span> erect vertical <span class="maths">F G</span>.</p>

<p>Produce <span class="maths">F B</span> to <span class="maths">H</span>, and make <span class="maths">F H</span> equal
to <span class="maths">A C</span>.</p>

<p>Now if the vertical altitude of the
pyramid (<span class="maths">C D</span> in <a href="#f.25">Fig. 25.</a>) be given,
make <span class="maths">F G</span> equal to this vertical altitude.</p>

<p><a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>80<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Join <span class="maths">G B</span> and <span class="maths">G H</span>.</p>

<p>Then <span class="maths">G B</span> and <span class="maths">G H</span> are the true magnitudes of <span class="maths">G B</span> and <span class="maths">G H</span>
in <a href="#f.56">Fig. 56.</a></p>

<p>If <span class="maths">G B</span> is given, and not the vertical altitude, with center
<span class="maths">B</span>, and distance <span class="maths">G B</span>, describe circle cutting <span class="maths">F G</span> in <span class="maths">G</span>, and <span class="maths">F G</span>
is the vertical altitude.</p>

<p>If <span class="maths">G H</span> is given, describe the circle from <span class="maths">H</span>, with distance
<span class="maths">G H</span>, and it will similarly cut <span class="maths">F G</span> in <span class="maths">G</span>.</p>

<p>It is especially necessary for the student to examine this
construction thoroughly, because in many complicated forms
of ornaments, capitals of columns, etc., the lines <span class="maths">B G</span> and
<span class="maths">G H</span> become the limits or bases of curves, which are elongated
on the longer (or angle) profile <span class="maths">G H</span>, and shortened on the
shorter (or lateral) profile <span class="maths">B G</span>. We will take a simple instance,
but must previously note another construction.</p>

<p>It is often necessary, when pyramids are the roots of some
ornamental form, to divide them horizontally at a given vertical
height. The shortest way of doing so is in general the
following.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.58" src="images/illus-090.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 58.</b></p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A E C</span>, <a href="#f.58">Fig. 58.</a>, be any pyramid on a square base <span class="maths">A B C</span>, and <span class="maths">A D C</span> the square pillar used in its construction.</p>

<p><a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>81<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Then by construction (<a href="#pr.x">Problem X.</a>) <span class="maths">B D</span> and <span class="maths">A F</span> are both
of the vertical height of the pyramid.</p>

<p>Of the diagonals, <span class="maths">F E</span>, <span class="maths">D E</span>, choose the shortest (in this case
<span class="maths">D E</span>), and produce it to cut the sight-line in <span class="maths">V</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore <span class="maths">V</span> is the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">D E</span>.</p>

<p>Divide <span class="maths">D B</span>, as may be required, into the sight-magnitudes
of the given vertical heights at which the pyramid is to be
divided.</p>
<p class="illo"><span class="lt"><img id="f.59" src="images/illus-091a.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br

<span class="rt"><img id="f.60" src="images/illus-091b.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>  Fig. 60.  </b></span></p>

<p>From the points of division, 1, 2, 3, etc., draw to the
vanishing-point <span class="maths">V</span>. The lines so drawn cut the angle line of
the pyramid, <span class="maths">B E</span>, at the required elevations. Thus, in the
figure, it is required to draw a horizontal black band on the
pyramid at three fifths of its height, and in breadth one
twentieth of its height. The line <span class="maths">B D</span> is divided into five
parts, of which three are counted from <span class="maths">B</span> upwards. Then
the line drawn to <span class="maths">V</span> marks the base of the black band. Then
one fourth of one of the five parts is measured, which similarly
gives the breadth of the band. The terminal lines of
the band are then drawn on the sides of the pyramid parallel
to <span class="maths">A B</span> (or to its vanishing-point if it has one), and to the
vanishing-point of <span class="maths">B C</span>.</p>

<p><a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>82<span class="ns">]<br

are awkwardly placed for use, bisect the nearest base line of
the pyramid in <span class="maths">B</span>, as in <a href="#f.59">Fig. 59.</a></p>

<p>Erect the vertical <span class="maths">D B</span> and join <span class="maths">G B</span> and <span class="maths">D G</span> (<span class="maths">G</span> being the
apex of pyramid).</p>

<p>Find the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">D G</span>, and use <span class="maths">D B</span> for division,
carrying the measurements to the line <span class="maths">G B</span>.</p>

<p>In <a href="#f.59">Fig. 59.</a>, if we join <span class="maths">A D</span> and <span class="maths">D C</span>, <span class="maths">A D C</span> is the vertical
profile of the whole pyramid, and <span class="maths">B D C</span> of the half pyramid,
corresponding to <span class="maths">F G B</span> in <a href="#f.57">Fig. 57.</a></p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.61" src="images/illus-092.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 61.</b></p>


<p>We may now proceed to an architectural example.</p>

<p>Let <span class="maths">A H</span>, <a href="#f.60">Fig. 60.</a>, be the vertical profile of the capital of
a pillar, <span class="maths">A B</span> the semi-diameter of its head or abacus, and <span class="maths">F D</span>
the semi-diameter of its shaft.</p>

<p>Let the shaft be circular, and the abacus square, down to
the level <span class="maths">E</span>.</p>

<p>Join <span class="maths">B D</span>, <span class="maths">E F</span>, and produce them to meet in <span class="maths">G</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore <span class="maths">E C G</span> is the semi-profile of a reversed pyramid
containing the capital.</p>

<p><a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>83<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Construct this pyramid, with the square of the abacus, in
the required perspective, as in <a href="#f.61">Fig. 61.</a>; making <span class="maths">A E</span> equal
to <span class="maths">A E</span> in <a href="#f.60">Fig. 60.</a>, and <span class="maths">A K</span>, the side of the square, equal to

<span class="maths">F</span> is the level of the point <span class="maths">F</span> in <a href="#f.60">Fig. 60.</a>, on the side of the

Then <span class="maths">F <var>n</var></span> and <span class="maths">F <var>m</var></span> are horizontal lines across the pyramid at
the level <span class="maths">F</span>, forming at that level two sides of a square.</p>

 /><b>Fig. 62.</b></p>

<p>Complete the square, and within it inscribe a circle, as in
Fig. 62., which is left unlettered that its construction may
be clear. At the extremities of this draw vertical lines,
which will be the sides of the shaft in its right place. It
will be found to be somewhat smaller in diameter than the
entire shaft in <a href="#f.60">Fig. 60.</a>, because at the center of the square
it is more distant than the nearest edge of the square abacus.
The curves of the capital may then be drawn approximately
by the eye. They are not quite accurate in <a href="#f.62">Fig. 62.</a>, there

 class="ns">[p</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>being a subtlety in their junction with the shaft which could
not be shown on so small a scale without confusing the student;
the curve on the left springing from a point a little
way round the circle behind the shaft, and that on the right
from a point on this side of the circle a little way within the
edge of the shaft. But for their more accurate construction
see <a href="#png.097">Notes on Problem XIV</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smc">It</span> is seldom that any complicated curve, except occasionally
a spiral, needs to be drawn in perspective; but the student
will do well to practice for some time any fantastic
shapes which he can find drawn on flat surfaces, as on wall-papers,
carpets, etc., in order to accustom himself to the
strange and great changes which perspective causes in them.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.63" src="images/illus-095.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 63.</b></p>

<p>The curves most required in architectural drawing, after
the circle, are those of pointed arches; in which, however, all
that will be generally needed is to fix the apex, and two
points in the sides. Thus if we have to draw a range of
pointed arches, such as <span class="maths">A P B</span>, <a href="#f.63">Fig. 63.</a>, draw the measured
arch to its sight-magnitude first neatly in a rectangle, <span class="maths">A B C D</span>; then draw the diagonals <span class="maths">A D</span> and <span class="maths">B C</span>; where they cut
the curve draw a horizontal line (as at the level <span class="maths">E</span> in the
figure), and carry it along the range to the vanishing-point,
fixing the points where the arches cut their diagonals all
along. If the arch is cusped, a line should be drawn, at <span class="maths">F</span> to
mark the height of the cusps, and verticals raised at <span class="maths">G</span> and <span class="maths">H</span>,
to determine the interval between them. Any other points
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>may be similarly determined, but these will usually be enough.
<a href="#f.63">Figure 63.</a> shows the perspective construction of a square
niche of good Veronese Gothic, with an uncusped arch of
similar size and curve beyond.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.64" src="images/illus-096.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 64.</b></p>

<p>In <a href="#f.64">Fig. 64.</a> the more distant arch only is lettered, as the
construction of the nearest explains itself more clearly to the
eye without letters. The more distant arch shows the general
construction for all arches seen underneath, as of
bridges, cathedral aisles, etc. The rectangle <span class="maths">A B C D</span> is first
drawn to contain the outside arch; then the depth of the
arch, <span class="maths">A <var>a</var></span>, is determined by the measuring-line, and the rectangle,
<var>a b c d</var>, drawn for the inner arch.</p>

<p><span class="maths">A <var>a</var></span>, <span class="maths">B <var>b</var></span>, etc., go to one vanishing-point; <span class="maths">A B</span>, <var>a b</var>, etc., to
the opposite one.</p>

<p>In the nearer arch another narrow rectangle is drawn to
determine the cusp. The parts which would actually come
into sight are slightly shaded.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Several</span> exercises will be required on this important
problem.</p>

<p>I. It is required to draw a circular flat-bottomed dish narrower
at the bottom than the top; the vertical depth being
given, and the diameter at the top and bottom.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.65" src="images/illus-097.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 65.</b></p>

<p>Let <var>a b</var>, <a href="#f.65">Fig. 65.</a>, be the diameter of the bottom, <var>a c</var> the
diameter of the top, and <var>a d</var> its vertical depth.</p>

<p>Take <span class="maths">A D</span> in position equal to <var>a c</var>.</p>

<p>On <span class="maths">A D</span> draw the square <span class="maths">A B C D</span>, and inscribe in it a circle.</p>

<p>Therefore, the circle so inscribed has the diameter of the
top of the dish.</p>

<p>From <span class="maths">A</span> and <span class="maths">D</span> let fall verticals, <span class="maths">A E</span>, <span class="maths">D H</span>, each equal to <var>a d</var>.</p>

<p>Join <span class="maths">E H</span>, and describe square <span class="maths">E F G H</span>, which accordingly
will be equal to the square <span class="maths">A B C D</span>, and be at the depth <var>a d</var>
beneath it.</p>

<p>Within the square <span class="maths">E F G H</span> describe a square <span class="maths">I K</span>, whose
diameter shall be equal to <var>a b</var>.</p>

<p>Describe a circle within the square <span class="maths">I K</span>. Therefore the
circle so inscribed has its diameter equal to <var>a b</var>; and it is
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the center of the square <span class="maths">E F G H</span>, which is vertically beneath
the square <span class="maths">A B C D</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore the circle in the square <span class="maths">I K</span> represents the bottom
of the dish.</p>

<p>Now the two circles thus drawn will either intersect one
another, or they will not.</p>

<p>If they intersect one another, as in the figure, and they
are below the eye, part of the bottom of the dish is seen
within it.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.66" src="images/illus-098a.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 66.</b></p>

<p>To avoid confusion, let us take then two intersecting circles
without the inclosing squares, as in <a href="#f.66">Fig. 66.</a></p>

<p>Draw right lines, <var>a b</var>, <var>c d</var>, touching both circles externally.
Then the parts of these lines which connect the circles are
the sides of the dish. They are drawn in <a href="#f.65">Fig. 65.</a> without
any prolongations, but the best way to construct them is as
in <a href="#f.66">Fig. 66.</a></p>

<p>If the circles do not intersect each other, the smaller must
either be within the larger or not within it.</p>

<p>If within the larger, the whole of the bottom of the dish
is seen from above, <a href="#f.67">Fig. 67.</a> <var>a</var>.</p>

<p class="illolt"><img id="f.67" src="images/illus-098b.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 67.</b></p>

<p>If the smaller circle is not within
the larger, none of the bottom is seen
inside the dish, <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>If the circles are above instead of
beneath the eye, the bottom of the
dish is seen beneath it, <var>c</var>.</p>

<p>If one circle is above and another
beneath the eye, neither the bottom
nor top of the dish is seen, <var>d</var>. Unless
the object be very large, the circles in
this case will have little apparent
curvature.</p>

<p>II. The preceding problem is simple,
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>because the lines of the profile of the object (<var>a b</var> and
<var>c d</var>, <a href="#f.66">Fig. 66.</a>) are straight. But if these lines of profile are
curved, the problem becomes much more complex: once mastered,
however, it leaves no farther difficulty in perspective.</p>

<p>Let it be required to draw a flattish circular cup or vase,
with a given curve of profile.</p>

<p>The basis of construction is given in <a href="#f.68">Fig. 68.</a>, half of it
only being drawn, in order that the eye may seize its lines
easily.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.68" src="images/illus-099.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 68.</b></p>

<p>Two squares (of the required size) are first drawn, one
above the other, with a given vertical interval, <span class="maths">A C</span>, between
them, and each is divided into eight parts by its diameters
and diagonals. In these squares two circles are drawn;
which are, therefore, of equal size, and one above the other.
Two smaller circles, also of equal size, are drawn within
these larger circles in the construction of the present problem;
more may be necessary in some, none at all in others.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the portions of the diagonals and diameters
of squares which are cut off between the circles
represent radiating planes, occupying the position of the
spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p>Now let the line <span class="maths">A E B</span>, <a href="#f.69">Fig. 69.</a>, be the profile of the vase
or cup to be drawn.</p>

<p>Inclose it in the rectangle <span class="maths">C D</span>, and if any portion of it is
not curved, as <span class="maths">A E</span>, cut off the curved portion by the vertical
line <span class="maths">E F</span>, so as to include it in the smaller rectangle <span class="maths">F D</span>.</p>

making the radius of its large outer circles equal to <span class="maths">A D</span>, and

<p>Then <var>x y</var> is the contour of the surface of the cup, and the

<p>III. All branched ornamentation, forms of flowers, capitals
of columns, machicolations of round towers, and other such
arrangements of radiating curve, are resolvable by this problem,
using more or fewer interior circles according to the
conditions of the curves. <a href="#f.70">Fig. 70.</a> is an example of the construction
of a circular group of eight trefoils with curved
stems. One outer or limiting circle is drawn within the
square <span class="maths">E D C F</span>, and the extremities of the trefoils touch it
at the extremities of its diagonals and diameters. A

 class="ns">[p</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>smaller circle is at the vertical distance <span class="maths">B C</span> below the larger,
and <span class="maths">A</span> is the angle of the square within which the smaller
circle is drawn; but the square is not given, to avoid confusion.
The stems of the trefoils form drooping curves, arranged
on the diagonals and diameters of the smaller circle,
which are dotted. But no perspective laws will do work of
this intricate kind so well as the hand and eye of a painter.</p>

<p>IV. There is one common construction, however, in which,
singularly, the hand and eye of the painter almost always
fail, and that is the fillet of any ordinary capital or base of
a circular pillar (or any similar form). It is rarely necessary
in practice to draw such minor details in perspective;
yet the perspective laws which regulate them should be understood,
else the eye does not see their contours rightly
until it is very highly cultivated.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.71" src="images/illus-102.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 71.</b></p>

<p>Fig. 71. will show the law with sufficient clearness; it
represents the perspective construction of a fillet whose profile
is a semicircle, such as <span class="maths">F H</span> in <a href="#f.60">Fig. 60.</a>, seen above the
eye. Only half the pillar with half the fillet is drawn, to
avoid confusion.</p>

<p><span class="maths">P Q</span> the thickness of the fillet, sight-magnitude at the shaft’s
center.</p>

<p>Round <span class="maths">P</span> a horizontal semicircle is drawn on the diameter
of the shaft <var>a b</var>.</p>

<p>Round <span class="maths">Q</span> another horizontal semicircle is drawn on diameter
<var>c d</var>.</p>

<p>These two semicircles are the upper and lower edges of the
fillet.</p>

<p>Then diagonals and diameters are drawn as in <a href="#f.68">Fig. 68.</a>,
and, at their extremities, semicircles in perspective, as in
<a href="#f.69">Fig. 69</a>.</p>

<p>The letters <span class="maths">A</span>, <span class="maths">B</span>, <span class="maths">C</span>, <span class="maths">D</span>, and <span class="maths">E</span>, indicate the upper and exterior
angles of the rectangles in which these semicircles are
to be drawn; but the inner vertical line is not dotted in the
rectangle at <span class="maths">C</span>, as it would have confused itself with other
lines.</p>

<p>Then the visible contour of the fillet is the line which incloses
and touches<a name="fn33" id="fn33"></a><a title="Go to footnote 33"

the shaft at the point <span class="maths">H</span>, but I have drawn it through
to the opposite extremity of the diameter at <var>d</var>.</p>

<p>Turned upside down the figure shows the construction of
a basic fillet.</p>

<p>The capital of a Greek Doric pillar should be drawn frequently
for exercise on this fourteenth problem, the curve
of its echinus being exquisitely subtle, while the general
contour is simple.</p>

<p><span class="smc">It</span> is often possible to shorten other perspective operations
considerably, by finding the vanishing-points of the inclined
lines of the object. Thus, in drawing the gabled roof in
Fig. 43., if the gable <span class="maths">A Y C</span> be drawn in perspective, and the
vanishing-point of <span class="maths">A Y</span> determined, it is not necessary to draw
the two sides of the rectangle, <span class="maths">A′ D′</span> and <span class="maths">D′ B′</span>, in order to determine
the point <span class="maths">Y′</span>; but merely to draw <span class="maths">Y Y′</span> to the vanishing-point
of <span class="maths">A A′</span> and <span class="maths">A′ Y′</span> to the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">A Y</span>,
meeting in <span class="maths">Y′</span>, the point required.</p>

<p>Again, if there be a series of gables, or other figures produced
by parallel inclined lines, and retiring to the point <span class="maths">V</span>,
as in <a href="#f.72">Fig. 72.</a>,<a name="fn34" id="fn34"></a><a title="Go to footnote 34"
 href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> it is not necessary to draw each separately,
but merely to determine their breadths on the line <span class="maths">A V</span>, and
draw the slopes of each to their vanishing-points, as shown
in <a href="#f.72">Fig. 72.</a> Or if the gables are equal in height, and a line
be drawn from <span class="maths">Y</span> to <span class="maths">V</span>, the construction resolves itself into a
zigzag drawn alternately to <span class="maths">P</span> and <span class="maths">Q</span>, between the lines <span class="maths">Y V</span>
and <span class="maths">A V</span>.</p>

<p>The student must be very cautious, in finding the vanishing-points
of inclined lines, to notice their relations to the
horizontals beneath them, else he may easily mistake the
horizontal to which they belong.</p>

<p>Thus, let <span class="maths">A B C D</span>, <a href="#f.73">Fig. 73.</a>, be a rectangular inclined plane,
and let it be required to find the vanishing-point of its diagonal
<span class="maths">B D</span>.</p>

<p>Find <span class="maths">V</span>, the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">A D</span> and <span class="maths">B C</span>.</p>

<p>Draw <span class="maths">A E</span> to the opposite vanishing-point, so that <span class="maths">D A E</span>
may represent a right angle.</p>

<p>Let fall from <span class="maths">B</span> the vertical <span class="maths">B E</span>, cutting <span class="maths">A E</span> in <span class="maths">E</span>.</p>

<p>Join <span class="maths">E D</span>, and produce it to cut the sight-line in <span class="maths">V′</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Before</span> examining the last three problems it is necessary
that you should understand accurately what is meant by the
position of an inclined plane.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of strong white pasteboard into any irregular
shape, and dip it in a sloped position into water. However
you hold it, the edge of the water, of course, will always
draw a horizontal line across its surface. The direction of
this horizontal line is the direction of the inclined plane.
(In beds of rock geologists call it their “strike.”)</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.74" src="images/illus-107.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 74.</b></p>

<p>Next, draw a semicircle on the piece of pasteboard; draw
its diameter, <span class="maths">A B</span>, <a href="#f.74">Fig. 74.</a>, and a vertical line from its center,
<span class="maths">C D</span>; and draw some other lines, <span class="maths">C E</span>, <span class="maths">C F</span>, etc., from the center
to any points in the circumference.</p>

<p>Now dip the piece of pasteboard again into water, and,
holding it at any inclination and in any direction you choose,
bring the surface of the water to the line <span class="maths">A B</span>. Then the
line <span class="maths">C D</span> will be the most steeply inclined of all the lines
drawn to the circumference of the circle; <span class="maths">G C</span> and <span class="maths">H C</span> will
be less steep; and <span class="maths">E C</span> and <span class="maths">F C</span> less steep still. The nearer
the lines to <span class="maths">C D</span>, the steeper they will be; and the nearer to
<span class="maths">A B</span>, the more nearly horizontal.</p>

<p><a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>98<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>When, therefore, the line <span class="maths">A B</span> is horizontal (or marks the
water surface), its direction is the direction of the inclined
plane, and the inclination of the line <span class="maths">D C</span> is the inclination
of the inclined plane. In beds of rock geologists call the
inclination of the line <span class="maths">D C</span> their “dip.”</p>

<p>To fix the position of an inclined plane, therefore, is to
determine the direction of any two lines in the plane, <span class="maths">A B</span>
and <span class="maths">C D</span>, of which one shall be horizontal and the other at
right angles to it. Then any lines drawn in the inclined
plane, parallel to <span class="maths">A B</span>, will be horizontal; and lines drawn
parallel to <span class="maths">C D</span> will be as steep as <span class="maths">C D</span>, and are spoken of in
the text as the “steepest lines” in the plane.</p>

<p>But farther, whatever the direction of a plane may be, if
it be extended indefinitely, it will be terminated, to the eye
of the observer, by a boundary line, which, in a horizontal
plane, is horizontal (coinciding nearly with the visible horizon);—in
a vertical plane, is vertical;—and, in an inclined
plane, is inclined.</p>

<p>This line is properly, in each case, called the “sight-line”
of such plane; but it is only properly called the “horizon”
in the case of a horizontal plane: and I have preferred using
always the term “sight-line,” not only because more comprehensive,
but more accurate; for though the curvature of the
earth’s surface is so slight that practically its visible limit
always coincides with the sight-line of a horizontal plane, it
does not mathematically coincide with it, and the two lines
ought not to be considered as theoretically identical, though
they are so in practice.</p>

<p>It is evident that all vanishing-points of lines in any plane
must be found on its sight-line, and, therefore, that the sight-line
of any plane may be found by joining any two of such
vanishing-points. Hence the construction of <a href="#pr.xviii">Problem XVIII</a>.</p>

<a href="#cor.ii.ii">Corollary.</a></p>

<p>Then by <a href="#pr.ii">Problem II.</a> <var>a b</var> is the line <span class="maths">A B</span> drawn in perspective;
and by its <a href="#cor.ii.ii">Corollary</a> <var>a e</var> is the line <span class="maths">A E</span> drawn in

<p class="gap">From <span class="maths">V</span> erect perpendicular <span class="maths">V P</span>, and produce <var>a b</var> to cut

<span class="maths">A T</span> in <var>f</var>.</p>

<p>Now in triangles <span class="maths">E B T</span> and <span class="maths">A E T</span>, as <var>e b</var> is parallel to <span class="maths">E B</span>
and <var>e f</var> to <span class="nw"><span class="maths">A E</span>;—</span><a name="eq10" id="eq10"></a><span class="nw"><span class="maths"><var>e b</var> ∶ <var>e f</var> ∷ E B ∶ A E</span></span><a title="See image"
 href="#eqn10" class="eqnlink">[<span class="ns">eqn </span>x]</a>.</p>

<p>But <span class="maths">T V</span> is also parallel to <span class="maths">A E</span> and <span class="maths">P V</span> to <var>e b</var>.</p>

<p>Therefore also in the triangles <span class="maths"><var>a</var> P V</span> and <span class="maths"><var>a</var> V T</span>,</p>

<div class="displaymath">
<a name="eq11" id="eq11"></a><span class="maths"><var>e b</var> ∶ <var>e f</var> ∷ P V ∶ V T</span><a title="See image"

<p>And, by construction, angle <span class="nw"><span class="maths">T P V = ∠ A E B</span>.</span></p>

<p>Therefore the triangles <span class="maths">T V P</span>, <span class="maths">A E B</span>, are similar; and <span class="maths">T P</span>
is parallel to <span class="maths">A B</span>.</p>

<p class="gap"><a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>104<span class="ns">]<br

for any inclined line <span class="maths">A B</span>, and a horizontal line <span class="maths">A E</span> in the
same vertical plane with it.</p>

<p>So that if we find the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">A E</span> in <span class="maths">V</span>, and
from <span class="maths">V</span> erect a vertical <span class="maths">V P</span>, and from <span class="maths">T</span> draw <span class="maths">T P</span> parallel
to <span class="maths">A B</span>, cutting <span class="maths">V P</span> in <span class="maths">P</span>, <span class="maths">P</span> will be the vanishing-point of <span class="maths">A B</span>,
and (by the same proof as that given at <a href="#png.027">page 17</a>) of all lines
parallel to it.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.77" src="images/illus-113.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 77.</b></p>

<p>Next, to find the dividing-point of the inclined line.</p>

<p>I remove some unnecessary lines from <a href="#f.76">the last figure</a> and
repeat it here, <a href="#f.77">Fig. 77.</a>, adding the measuring-line <span class="maths"><var>a</var> M</span>, that
the student may observe its position with respect to the other
lines before I remove any more of them.</p>

<p>Now if the line <span class="maths">A B</span> in this diagram represented the length
of the line <span class="maths">A B</span> in reality (as <span class="maths">A B</span> <em>does</em> in <a href="#f.10">Figs. 10.</a> and <a href="#f.11">11.</a>),
we should only have to proceed to modify <a href="#cor.ii.iii">Corollary III.</a> of
<a href="#pr.ii">Problem II.</a> to this new construction. We shall see presently
that <span class="maths">A B</span> does not represent the actual length of the inclined
line <span class="maths">A B</span> in nature, nevertheless we shall first proceed as if it
did, and modify our result afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>In <a href="#f.77">Fig. 77.</a> draw <var>a d</var> parallel to <span class="maths">A B</span>, cutting <span class="maths">B T</span> in <var>d</var>.</p>

<p>Therefore <var>a d</var> is the sight-magnitude of <span class="maths">A B</span>, as <span class="maths"><var>a</var> R</span> is of
<span class="maths">A B</span> in <a href="#f.11">Fig. 11.</a></p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.78" src="images/illus-114.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 78.</b></p>

<p>Remove again from the figure all lines except <span class="maths">P V</span>, <span class="maths">V T</span>, <span class="maths">P T</span>,
<var>a b</var>, <var>a d</var>, and the measuring-line.</p>

<p>Set off on the measuring-line <var>a m</var> equal to <var>a d</var>.</p>

<p>Draw <span class="maths">P Q</span> parallel to <var>a m</var>, and through <var>b</var> draw <span class="maths"><var>m</var> Q</span>, cutting
<span class="maths">P Q</span> in <span class="maths">Q</span>.</p>

<p>Then, by the proof already given in <a href="#png.030">page 20</a>, <span class="nw"><span class="maths">P Q</span> = <span class="maths">P T</span>.</span></p>

<p>Therefore if <span class="maths">P</span> is the vanishing-point of an inclined line
<span class="maths">A B</span>, and <span class="maths">Q P</span> is a horizontal line drawn through it, make <span class="maths">P Q</span>
equal to <span class="maths">P T</span>, and <var>a m</var> on the measuring-line equal to the
sight-magnitude of the line <span class="maths">A B</span> <em>in the diagram</em>, and the line
joining <span class="maths"><var>m</var> Q</span> will cut <span class="maths"><var>a</var> P</span> in <var>b</var>.</p>

<p class="gap">We have now, therefore, to consider what relation the
length of the line <span class="maths">A B</span> in this diagram, <a href="#f.77">Fig. 77.</a>, has to the
length of the line <span class="maths">A B</span> in reality.</p>

<p>Now the line <span class="maths">A E</span> in <a href="#f.77">Fig. 77.</a> represents the length of <span class="maths">A E</span>
in reality.</p>

<p>But the angle <span class="maths">A E B</span>, <a href="#f.77">Fig. 77.</a>, and the corresponding angle
in all the constructions of the earlier problems, is in reality a
right angle, though in the diagram necessarily represented as
obtuse.</p>

<p class="illort"><img id="f.79" src="images/illus-115.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 79.</b></p>

<p>Therefore, if from <span class="maths">E</span> we draw <span class="maths">E C</span>, as in <a href="#f.79">Fig. 79.</a>, at right
angles to <span class="maths">A E</span>, make <span class="maths">E C</span> <span class="nw">= <span class="maths">E B</span></span>, and join
<span class="maths">A C</span>, <span class="maths">A C</span> will be the real length of the line
<span class="maths">A B</span>.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, if instead of <var>a m</var> in <a href="#f.78">Fig. 78.</a>, we take the real length of <span class="maths">A B</span>, that real
length will be to <var>a m</var> as <span class="maths">A C</span> to <span class="maths">A B</span> in <a href="#f.79">Fig. 79.</a></p>

<p>And then, if the line drawn to the measuring-line
<span class="maths">P Q</span> is still to cut <span class="maths"><var>a</var> P</span> in <var>b</var>, it is evident that the
line <span class="maths">P Q</span> must be shortened in the same ratio that <var>a m</var> was
shortened; and the true dividing-point will be <span class="maths">Q′</span> in <a href="#f.80">Fig. 80.</a>,
fixed so that <span class="maths">Q′ P</span><!-- TN: original reads "P′" --> shall be to <span class="maths">Q P</span> as <var>a m′</var> is to <var>a m</var>; <var>a m′</var> representing
the real length of <span class="maths">A B</span>.</p>

<p><a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>106<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But <var>a m′</var> is therefore to <var>a m</var> as <span class="maths">A C</span> is to <span class="maths">A B</span> in <a href="#f.79">Fig. 79.</a></p>

<p>Therefore <span class="maths">P Q′</span> must be to <span class="maths">P Q</span> as <span class="maths">A C</span> is to <span class="maths">A B</span>.</p>

<p>But <span class="maths">P Q</span> equals <span class="maths">P T</span> (<a href="#f.78">Fig. 78.</a>); and <span class="maths">P V</span> is to <span class="maths">V T</span> (in <a href="#f.78">Fig. 78.</a>) as <span class="maths">B E</span> is to <span class="maths">A E</span> (<a href="#f.79">Fig. 79.</a>).</p>

<p>Hence we have only to substitute <span class="maths">P V</span> for <span class="maths">E C</span>, and <span class="maths">V T</span> for
<span class="maths">A E</span>, in <a href="#f.79">Fig. 79.</a>, and the resulting diagonal <span class="maths">A C</span> will be the
required length of <span class="maths">P Q′</span>.</p>

<p class="illo"><img id="f.80" src="images/illus-116.png" alt="[Geometric diagram]" /><br
 /><b>Fig. 80.</b></p>

<p>It will be seen that the construction given in the text
(<a href="#f.46">Fig. 46.</a>) is the simplest means of obtaining this magnitude,
for <span class="maths">V D</span> in <a href="#f.46">Fig. 46.</a> (or <span class="maths">V M</span> in <a href="#f.15">Fig. 15.</a>) = <span class="maths">V T</span> by construction
in <a href="#pr.iv">Problem IV</a>. It should, however, be observed,
that the distance <span class="maths">P Q′</span> or <span class="maths">P X</span>, in <a href="#f.46">Fig. 46.</a>, may be laid on the
sight-line of the inclined plane itself, if the measuring-line
be drawn parallel to that sight-line. And thus any form may
be drawn on an inclined plane as conveniently as on a horizontal
one, with the single exception of the radiation of the
verticals, which have a vanishing-point, as shown in <a href="#pr.xx">Problem XX</a>.</p>
